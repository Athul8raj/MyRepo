This app lets you analyse a big chunk of data in a excel or csv format which are hundreds of GBs of data keeping in mind the memory load.It will show you how much memory the original file consumed and after conversion how much it consumes.

This app makes use of Pandas library which converts the integers floating numbers and strings into their lowest possible memory allocation(int64 to int8, float64 to float32 and categorising unique strings as integers in memory.

Coupling this with ever powerful flask framework , this app not only lets you know memory but in the coming versions will help you visualise the data using matplot lib library.

I have used the pipenv coomand to create the pipfile and pipfile.lock, so you guys can check it out.

Dont forget to click on the Star for me :)
