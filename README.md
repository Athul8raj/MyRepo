# MyRepo
Here u can find my two Projects that i developed.

#MyFlaskApp Project

This project contains Flask microframework based web app with integration to Celery through Redis and Database connection through SQLAlchemy

Database is Postgres.

So this app enables user to register login and review materials on the app.User can contribute and when user adds anything it will sent as an email through Celery to my mailbox so that i can approve it.

Once the user add a Course URL it will be sent as a mail with the course details to the approver uwho can then add if applicable to the DB.

Shout out to the youtubers that helped me along this development especially Corey Schafer, traversy Media and so many intelligent guys out there and books that i went through to start this app project.

#ng5bs4fb project

This is a Angular 5 with bootstrap 4 and a noSQl database based app(here i have made use of Google's Firebase Db)

This app provides user to basically register,Login and browse through the various Study material courses regarding various technologies and Users can add thier own contributions which will be approved by Admin(me :))

Registrations are provided through Facebook, Google(gmail) and email verification after which the user can login(if authenticated) and view the material inside the app.

I will come up with new ways of making this app user friendly like voice activated buttons like speech recognition ability and so on.
